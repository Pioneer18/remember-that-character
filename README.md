# remember-that-character (A React Application)

Remember that character is an Adventure Time theme memorization game. To play the game you must click on each character only one time until you have clicked on all 12 characters. After each click all of the character cards are quickly shuffled and you must be careful to remember which characters you have selected so far. Any double clicks will immediately reset the game.
